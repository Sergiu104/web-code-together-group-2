      Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) is the seventh
      studio album by the English rock band the Kinks (pictured), released 10
      October 1969. Kinks frontman Ray Davies constructed the concept album as
      the soundtrack to a Granada Television play with Julian Mitchell, but the
      television programme was cancelled and never produced. The plot revolves
      around Arthur Morgan, a carpet-layer based on Arthur Anning, the
      brother-in-law of Ray and guitarist Dave Davies. The album received
      generally positive reviews and generous coverage in the US rock press. The
      lead single, "Victoria", peaked at number 62 on the Billboard charts in
      1969, the Kinks' highest position there since "Sunny Afternoon" in 1966.
      The album itself reached number 50 in the US on the Record World charts,
      and number 105 on Billboard. Arthur paved the way for the success of the
      Kinks' 1970 album Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One and
      its accompanying US Top 10 and UK Top 5 hit "Lola". (Full article...)
